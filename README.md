Hi there if you are reading this cuz u probably found this dots laying in github.

My minimalist rice :
A clean minimal rice made for u for a starter ricing journey.

## Features
This rice features a couple of waybar configs with css files in the config file
A simple rofi theme based on wallpaper loupe that u can find in the wallpapers folder
Color pallets based one wallpaper loupe 
Minimal and super lightweight with power profile daemon(minimal-dark.jsonc and minimal-dark.css in waybar folder)

## Cloning 
These dots are not full dots and are meant to copy the folder
You can replace the hypr folder with mine as it contains many good stuff and easy keybinds and a minimal dark waybar at start
clone the repo by:
For Arch-

1. $ sudo pacman -S git
2. $ git clone https://github.com/tester-dakhs/dots.git

and ur done

## Themes(incompleate)
The themes contains waybar configs for a set of wallpaper as namedm,
Switch theme waybar refers to the switch wallpaper
Switch-gray or switch-purple is reffered to the switch-gray and switch-purple wallpaper

The themes are incompleate because they are meant to be coustomised totally by you.
Path to themes = config/mythemes/
The waybar config andd css named dark-minimal must be applied with the wallpaper mono(any)

## NOTE 
The waybar configs and css are named as their theme so u can pair the waybar config and css with the right wallpaper
for best asthetics and there are extra minimal wallpapers in the folder.

There are more than 2 styles of waybar so I strongly recommend launching waybar with -c and -s
to tell the jsonc and css file so waybar can load from that file.

## Screenshots
For now there are no screenshtos because for a reason my hyprland got reset after posting these dots
but trust the themes and waybar configs u will love it.

## Generated Colors
The generated colors u see are made by matugen the wallpaper used here is mono-loupe one

1. Rofi- for app launching

## !DISCLAIMER!

This is repo is not maintained by me or someone these dots are here for your started hyprland rice that u can clone it and replace the needed files with your orignal config and move the wallpapers to its directory or where u want.

This repo is made by me and i am a kid who is 13yrs old so dont expect me to make dots with quickshell or python but however i will be posting another dots after like 3 months as i m learning python, c, c++ and qml language which will take a long time to make and i will be making it at any cost.

## !!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!
Ahh another note to read right? well this is really important as dont know how to make a theme switcher for hyprland so i have left some waybar configs at mythemes folder in .config it was there for my theme but i dont know how to make it so i left the configs and css files in there, the waybar themes actually are related to some wallpapers like the default one is related to purple leaves wallpaper and other like switch are related to switch wallpaper, another last thing is that there is a zshrc in there so if u like it just add a dot before its name and move to ur .config.  





And thats it enjoy the dots!.
