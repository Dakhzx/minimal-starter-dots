Hi there if you are reading this cuz u probably found this dots laying in github.
~~~~~~~~~
This is repo is not maintained by me or someone these dots are here for your started hyprland rice that u can clone it and replace the needed files with your orignal config and move the wallpapers to its directory or where u want.

This repo is made by me and i am a kid who is 13yrs old so dont expect me to make dots with quickshell or python but however i will be posting another dots after like 3 months as i m learning python, c, c++ and qml language which will take a long time to make and i will be making it at any cost.

!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!
Ahh another note to read right? well this is really important as dont know how to make a theme switcher for hyprland so i have left some waybar configs at mythemes folder in .config it was there for my theme but i dont know how to make it so i left the configs and css files in there, the waybar themes actually are related to some wallpapers like the default one is related to purple leaves wallpaper and other like switch are related to switch wallpaper, another last thing is that there is a zshrc in there so if u like it just add a dot before its name and move to ur .config.


AND THAT'S IT ENJOY
